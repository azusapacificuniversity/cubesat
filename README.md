# cubesat
This repository houses the design documents, files, code, etc in a multi-year project for [Azusa Pacific Univeristy](https://www.apu.edu/)'s department of [Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.apu.edu/clas/computerscience/) to design, fabricate, test, and have launched our very own nanosatellite!

A great primer on CubeSats is [NASA's CubeSat 101: Basic Concepts and Processes for First-Time CubeSat Developers (pdf)](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_csli_cubesat_101_508.pdf) from their page [https://www.nasa.gov/content/cubesat-launch-initiative-resources](https://www.nasa.gov/content/cubesat-launch-initiative-resources).
