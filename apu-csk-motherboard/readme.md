[Autodesk Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/) Schematic, Board, and Library files for an APU-designed Open Source Hardware Pumpkin CubeSat
Kit-compatible Slot 0 Motherboard.  

This is a template, mechanically it should work, but electrically it doesn't really do much yet.  This is the
board outline and connectors for the main modules: a 104-pin CSK bus
with H1 and H2 connectors, an [iceWerx module](https://www.robotshop.com/en/devantech-icewerx-ice40-hx8k-fpga.html) with a Lattice iCE40HX8K
FPGA, and a Feather-compatible socket, which can take any number of
microcontroller boards such as the [SparkFun RISC-V RED-V Thing Plus](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15799) or the
[Adafruit ESP32 Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405).  

This board is designed to work with the [Pumpkin Space](https://www.pumpkinspace.com/) - [CubeSat Kit Frame](http://cubesatkit.com/), for example parts:
```
710-00794       Base Plate Assembly
703-00289       Chassis Walls
710-00713       Large Aperture Cover Plate Assembly
